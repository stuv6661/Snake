This is a sand box designed for MLV developpers who want to test recent 
changes added in the MLV source without having to install the MLV library.

This sandbox function only when you configure the source code in the 
developpement. That means when you have typed:
	./configure --enable-dev

To use that sandbox, you just have to 
	create a source file, for example:
		litle_program.c
	compile that file by typing:
		make litle_program
	and execute the result :
		./litle_program

To use gdb debuggeur, you have to type:
	libtool --mode=execute gdb ./litle_program

To use valgrind debuggeur, you have to type:
	libtool --mode=execute valgrind ./litle_program

To clean the directory, you can type:
	make clean
