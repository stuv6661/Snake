%description
The mlv library is a simplified multimedia libary.
The library permit to:
 - draw figures, text and boxed text,
 - display images,
 - plays musics,
 - get Keyboard and mouse event
 - get informations by input boxes
This tools is a simplified interface of the SDL libraries.
If you are not a beginner, we recommend you to use the 
SDL libraries (sdl, sdl-gfx, sdl-sound,sdl-ttf) instead of
the mlv library.
The mlv library can be compiled for Linux, Macintosh 
and windows.
This package provide the runtime binary needed by the
execution of program using the mlv library.
