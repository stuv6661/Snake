        ====================================


To construt the windows packages of the MLV library,
follow these instructions:
1) Configure the MLV Library ( ./configure )
2) In the package/windows directory, execute the 3 following scripts:
- create_code_blocks_package

- The mlv-X.X-code_blocks.zip archive contains a code::blocks project with the 
  binaries of the MLV Library.
